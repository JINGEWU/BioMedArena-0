## Running benchmarks

### Single cell via the CLI

```bash
bioagent run \
    --benchmark medcalc \
    --backbone claude-sonnet-4-6 \
    --mode deep_think \
    --limit 10
```

Output: per-task results printed to stdout plus (if `--output`
specified) a per-task JSON summary. Use `scripts/run_matrix.py`
(below) to get the 22-column CSV and per-task traces.

### Matrix runner

Define a YAML at `configs/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
run_name: custom_run

backbones:
  - id: claude
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    api_key_env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - id: gemini
    provider: gemini
    model: gemini-2.5-flash
    api_key_env: GEMINI_API_KEY

modes_default: [simple_llm, deep_think]

benchmarks:
  - name: medcalc
    loader: load_medcalc_tasks
    kwargs: {limit: 30}
    benchmark_key: medcalc
  - name: labbench
    loader: load_labbench_tasks
    kwargs: {limit: 10, subsets: ["LitQA2", "ProtocolQA"]}
    benchmark_key: labbench

seeds: [42]

cost_monitor:
  hard_stop_usd: 50
  soft_warn_usd: 30

timeout:
  per_task_s: 240
  per_cell_s: 1800

base_config: config.yaml
```

Run:

```bash
python scripts/run_matrix.py --config configs/custom_matrix.yaml
```

### Runner flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--config PATH` | matrix YAML (default `configs/matrix_default.yaml`) |
| `--run-name NAME` | directory prefix (default: config `run_name` or `matrix`) |
| `--output-dir PATH` | explicit output directory (overrides `--run-name + timestamp`) |
| `--limit-override N` | force every benchmark's `kwargs.limit` to `N` (useful for dry runs) |
| `--only` | filter to specific cells: `benchmark,backbone,mode;benchmark,backbone,mode;...` |
| `--patch --benchmarks X,Y` | append specific benchmarks to the latest existing `data/runs/matrix_*` dir |

### Output layout

```
data/runs/<run_name>_<timestamp>/
├── <backbone_id>__<mode>__<benchmark>.json      # per-cell summary
├── MATRIX_SUMMARY.json                          # cell-level aggregates
├── results.csv                                  # 22-column per-cell rows
└── traces/
    └── <backbone_id>__<mode>__<benchmark>/
        └── <task_id>.json                       # full trace per task
```

No existing directory is ever overwritten: each run gets a fresh
timestamped subfolder.

### Avoiding duplicate runs

`--patch` only appends *new* cells whose per-cell JSON doesn't yet
exist. To genuinely re-run a cell, delete its per-cell JSON first.

---

## CSV schema

Each run produces `results.csv` with **22 columns** and one row per
cell (`benchmark × backbone × mode × seed`).

### Column order (preserve when reading)

```
benchmark, backbone, mode, seed,
n_tasks, n_correct, n_error, accuracy,
total_cost_usd, avg_cost_per_task_usd,
total_input_tokens, total_output_tokens,
avg_input_tokens, avg_output_tokens,
avg_tool_calls, avg_iterations, tool_call_success_rate,
unique_tools_used, top_tool, top_tool_call_count,
avg_latency_s, timestamp
```

---

## Column definitions

Each column is computed from the list of `TraceRecorder` objects for
the tasks in the cell.

| Column | Computed as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `benchmark` | `task.benchmark_name` | E.g., `medcalc` |
| `backbone` | Config backbone string | E.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `mode` | Harness mode | simple_llm / deep_think / light / heavy |
| `seed` | Config `seeds[0]` | Default `42` |
| `n_tasks` | `len(traces)` | Sample size N |
| `n_correct` | `sum(t.scorer_result.correct for t in traces)` | k |
| `n_error` | `sum(1 for t in traces if any(c.error for c in t.llm_calls))` | Runtime errors, not scorer failures |
| `accuracy` | `n_correct / n_tasks` | Strict: errors count as wrong. 0.0 if n_tasks=0 |
| `total_cost_usd` | `sum(t.total_cost_usd() for t in traces)` | All LLM calls in the cell |
| `avg_cost_per_task_usd` | `total_cost_usd / n_tasks` | |
| `total_input_tokens` | `sum(t.total_input_tokens() for t in traces)` | Sum over all LLM calls |
| `total_output_tokens` | `sum(t.total_output_tokens() for t in traces)` | Includes thinking tokens for `deep_think` |
| `avg_input_tokens` | `total_input_tokens / n_tasks` | |
| `avg_output_tokens` | `total_output_tokens / n_tasks` | |
| `avg_tool_calls` | `total_tool_calls / n_tasks` | simple_llm and deep_think are 0 by contract |
| `avg_iterations` | `total_iterations / n_tasks` | simple_llm=1, deep_think=1, light=1–N, heavy=2 |
| `tool_call_success_rate` | `n_tool_ok / n_tool_calls` | 1.0 if no tool calls |
| `unique_tools_used` | `len({c.name for c in all_tool_calls})` | Distinct tool names |
| `top_tool` | Most-called tool name | `""` if no tool calls |
| `top_tool_call_count` | Count of top tool | 0 if no tool calls |
| `avg_latency_s` | `sum(t.total_latency_s) / n_tasks` | End-to-end wall time per task |
| `timestamp` | Cell completion time | ISO 8601 UTC |

### Iteration counting convention

- `simple_llm` — 1 (single LLM call)
- `deep_think` — 1 (single LLM call with provider reasoning budget)
- `light` — 1 per ReAct loop iteration (typically 1–N where N=max_iterations)
- `heavy` — Triage + Reason = 2 (or 1 if the confidence gate falls back to deep_think)
- `self_consistency:*` — inherits the chosen inner mode

### Edge case handling

- `n_tasks = 0` → `accuracy = 0.0` (never NaN)
- No tool calls → `avg_tool_calls=0`, `tool_call_success_rate=1.0`, `unique_tools_used=0`, `top_tool=""`, `top_tool_call_count=0`
- Provider does not return token usage → treated as 0
- If a cell fails entirely, its row is omitted; the per-cell JSON still lands on disk with an error note

## Per-task traces

Every task produces a detailed JSON trace at
`data/runs/<run>/traces/<cell_name>/<task_id>.json`.

Contents:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `task_id`, `benchmark`, `backbone`, `mode` | Identifiers |
| `started_at`, `finished_at`, `total_latency_s` | Timing |
| `iterations` | ReAct-loop count (see convention above) |
| `llm_calls[]` | Each LLM turn: `system`, `messages` (truncated), `response_text`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cost_usd`, `latency_ms`, `finish_reason`, `error` |
| `tool_calls[]` | Each tool invocation: `iteration`, `name`, `arguments` (truncated), `result_preview` (first 500 chars), `success`, `error`, `latency_ms` |
| `final_answer` | Truncated to 4000 chars |
| `scorer_result` | `correct`, `method`, `details` (including `primary_verdict`, `primary_method`, `is_open_ended`, `judge_invoked`, `judge_verdict`, `judge_model`) |

Traces are excluded from git (via `.gitignore`) because they contain
raw LLM output that may include copyrighted benchmark question text.

Long messages and tool arguments are truncated to keep trace files
reasonable in size (4KB per message, 2KB per content block, 1KB per
tool argument).

## LLM-as-judge scoring

The scoring pipeline has two routes depending on the task
`answer_type`. Implemented in `harness/eval/llm_judge.py::score_with_fallback`.

### Route A — MCQ / structured (judge as fallback)

Applies to: `answer_type` ∈ `{multipleChoice, numeric, exact, exactNumeric, exactMatch}`, plus any task with no explicit `answer_type`.

1. Primary scorer (letter match, numeric tolerance, regex) runs.
2. If primary says **correct** → final = correct. Judge is **not** called.
3. If primary says **incorrect** and the candidate is empty → final = incorrect. Judge is **not** called (no point).
4. If primary says **incorrect** and the candidate is non-empty → LLM judge is invoked.
    - Judge **correct** → promote to correct. `method = primary:<type>+llm_judge_fallback(<model>)`
    - Judge **incorrect** → stay incorrect. `method` unchanged.
5. **The judge can only promote. It can never demote.** Re-scoring an existing dataset with this path is monotonically non-decreasing.

### Route B — Open-ended (judge as primary)

Applies to: `answer_type` ∈ `{openText, openEnded, freeText}`.

1. Primary deterministic scorer still runs, but its verdict is **metadata only**. It is preserved in `scorer_result.details.primary_verdict`.
2. LLM judge is invoked as the **primary scorer**.
3. Judge verdict is authoritative: `method = llm_judge_primary(<model>)`.

### Benchmark routing

| Benchmark | answer_type | Route |
|---|---|---|
| medcalc | exactNumeric / numeric | A (fallback) |
| medxpertqa | multipleChoice | A (fallback) |
| labbench, labbench2 | multipleChoice / regex | A (fallback) |
| gpqa_bio | multipleChoice | A (fallback) |
| hle_gold | multipleChoice (or openText per task) | per-task routing |
| medagentbench | numeric | A (fallback) |
| agentclinic | openText | B (primary) |
| bioasq | keyword | A (fallback) |
| pathvqa | keyword | A (fallback) |
| medqa, medmcqa, pubmedqa, mmlu | multipleChoice | A (fallback) |

Tasks with no explicit `answer_type` default to Route A.

### Judge model

Always `claude-sonnet-4-5`, regardless of the backbone being
evaluated. Using a single consistent judge keeps cross-run comparisons
stable and removes target-dependent variability.

Cost implication: judge calls are more expensive than the previous
dynamic policy (~10x per judge call). The judge is only invoked
under Route A when the primary scorer says incorrect AND the
candidate is non-empty, and under Route B for every open-ended
task. Typical runs see judge cost as a small fraction of total LLM
spend.

### Enable / disable

```bash
# Default: judge is ENABLED
python scripts/run_matrix.py --config configs/custom_matrix.yaml

# Disable globally
BIOAGENT_LLM_JUDGE=0 python scripts/run_matrix.py --config configs/custom_matrix.yaml
```

Every trace records `scorer_result.details.judge_invoked` and
`judge_verdict` so disagreement analysis is trivial post-hoc.

### Failure handling

If the judge API call errors, the primary verdict is kept and the
error is recorded in `scorer_result.details.judge_error`. Judge
failure never aborts a benchmark run.

## Supported models and modes

### Backbones

The CLI currently exposes **22 registered model IDs**. The manuscript
matrix evaluates 12 backbones: 5 open-weight systems served through
local inference infrastructure and 7 closed-source systems accessed via
provider APIs.

| Model ID | Provider / route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-sonnet-4` | Anthropic | Claude 4 Sonnet family |
| `claude-sonnet-4-5` | Anthropic | Default judge model in this release |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic | Claude Sonnet release target |
| `claude-opus-4-5` | Anthropic | Claude Opus family |
| `claude-opus-4-6` | Anthropic | Claude Opus release target |
| `gpt-4o` | OpenAI | General OpenAI chat model |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Google | Gemini Flash release path |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | Google | Gemini Pro release path |
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Google | Gemini 3 Flash-compatible ID |
| `grok` | xAI | xAI/Grok alias |
| `grok-4` | xAI | xAI/Grok 4-compatible ID |
| `openai-compatible` | Generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Any `/v1/chat/completions` server or router |
| `vllm` | OpenAI-compatible local server | vLLM-served open models |
| `tgi` | OpenAI-compatible local/server route | HuggingFace TGI-compatible inference |
| `sglang` | OpenAI-compatible local server | SGLang-served open models |
| `ollama` | OpenAI-compatible local server | Ollama local models |
| `lmstudio` | OpenAI-compatible local server | LM Studio local models |
| `llamacpp` | OpenAI-compatible local server | llama.cpp server route |
| `huggingface-openai` | Hosted OpenAI-compatible route | HuggingFace Inference Providers |
| `groq-openai` | Hosted OpenAI-compatible route | Groq-hosted inference |
| `together-openai` | Hosted OpenAI-compatible route | Together AI |
| `fireworks-openai` | Hosted OpenAI-compatible route | Fireworks AI |

List at runtime: `bioagent list-backbones`.

### Modes

| Mode | Description | Tools? | Iterations |
|---|---|---|---|
| simple_llm | Single LLM call | no | 1 |
| deep_think | Single LLM call with provider reasoning budget | no | 1 |
| light | Single-turn tool calling with scratchpad working memory (1–N rounds) | yes | 1–N (per_benchmark `DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS`) |
| heavy | Multi-turn ReAct with tool retrieval | yes | 2 (or 1 if confidence gate escalates to deep_think) |

`self_consistency:<inner>` wraps any of the above modes with majority
voting (N samples, configurable via config YAML). Enable via CLI with
`--self-consistency`.

The manuscript-level taxonomy describes 6 harness families by combining
single-rollout function calling, ReAct-style tool use, OpenSeeker-style
search, self-consistency, and light/heavy Mutual-Evolve variants. The
public CLI keeps the stable 4-mode operational surface above and exposes
self-consistency as a wrapper.

List at runtime: `bioagent list-modes`.

### Context management

The paper reports 6 context-management strategies: planning/scratchpad,
memory, summarization, clearing, truncation, and rollback. In the public
CLI, light mode enables scratchpad-style working memory by default while
preserving environment-variable ablations; the other strategies are
optional composition layers for long traces and recovery runs.

### deep_think purity contract

`deep_think` is intentionally identical to `simple_llm` in every
respect *except* that the provider's native reasoning budget is
enabled. Enforced by `tests/unit/test_modes_purity.py`:

- Same system prompt and same user prompt (no "think step by step"
  nudge at the prompt layer; the model's native thinking handles that)
- Zero tool schemas advertised
- No ReAct loop, no tool retrieval
- Exactly one LLM call per task
- Token output includes the model's internal thinking trace, counted
  in `output_tokens`

Provider-level reasoning (transparent to the user):

- Anthropic Claude 4.5+: `thinking={type: enabled, budget_tokens: N}`
- OpenAI o-series (`o1/o3/o4-mini`): `max_completion_tokens` + `developer` role for system
- OpenAI gpt-5.x: `reasoning_effort="high"` with graceful fallback
- Google Gemini 2.5+: `ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=N)`
